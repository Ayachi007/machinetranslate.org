> The AI revolution is changing the landscape of the global translation industry with language being at the core of AI. This is opening up an abundance of opportunities for the traditional translation industry. Advanced business models, more efficient workflows, evolving professions and state-of-the-art technologies are developing. Over the course of two days, TAUS will put all of these topics and more on the table, to be discussed and brainstormed with 50+ attendees of the TAUS events in Tokyo 2024.
