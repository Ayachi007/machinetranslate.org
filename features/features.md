    type: ItemList

Machine translation features vary in ready-to-use machine translation APIs and applications:

- [language support](/languages/languages.md)
- [customisation](/customisation/customisation.md)
- [data confidentiality](/features/data-confidentiality.md)
- [pricing](/features/pricing.md)

They also vary by their underlying architecture.

Some providers offer ready-to-use systems that can be integrated immediately.
Others train a model from scratch — or use a pre-trained model — and deploy and maintain it.

Raw models usually do not include the features included in many production systems:

- [language identification](/customisation/language-identification.md)
- segmentation
- [bridging](/applications/advanced-concepts/bridging.md) (pivoting)
- [glossary](/customisation/glossaries.md)
- encoding options
- HTML/XML tag handling
